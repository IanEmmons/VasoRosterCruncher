While scanning your school's team rosters in Scilympiad, VASO has discovered
that %1$d of those students do not have a matching permission form in the
VASO Portal.  Please request that the parents of these students submit the
required permission from in the VASO Portal to avoid having these students
barred from competition.

Thank you,

VASO registration coordinator
