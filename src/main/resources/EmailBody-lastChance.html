	<p>Hello,</p>

	<p>Virginia Science Olympiad has sent this email to %1$s because some of your team members are missing a parent permission in the VASO Portal.  <u>In order for your team members to compete, this situation must be remedied by 8:00 tomorrow evening (Friday).</u></p>

	<p class="emphasized">At 8:00 PM Friday we will close the permission form and any students without a permission will be removed from your Scilympiad roster and unable to compete.</p>

	<p>We know that you all are trying hard to get these permission slips from parents. We&rsquo;re sorry that this has been difficult.</p>

	<p><i>Scilympiad Students with no Permission in the Portal:</i> Please direct parents here: <a href="%2$s">%2$s</a></p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Last Name</th>
			<th>First Name</th>
			<th>Grade</th>
		</tr>
%3$s	</table>

	<p>If you have any questions, you can reply to this email.</p>
