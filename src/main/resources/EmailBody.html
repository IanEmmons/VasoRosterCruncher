	<p>Virginia Science Olympiad has sent this email to brambleton ms because some of your team members are missing a parent permission in the VASO Portal.  <u>In order for your team members to compete, this situation must be remedied.</u></p>

	<p><i>Scilympiad Students with no Permission in the Portal:</i> These students are on your team in Scilympiad, but as of now they will be barred from competition because they have no parent permission.  Usually, this just means that you need to remind these students&rsquo; parents to submit a permission form.  Please direct parents here:
<a href="https://virginiaso.knack.com/vaso-div-a-fall-2021#add-student/"
>https://virginiaso.knack.com/vaso-div-a-fall-2021#add-student/</a></p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Last Name</th>
			<th>First Name</th>
			<th>Grade</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>bejjanki</td>
			<td>nikhila</td> 
			<td>7</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>bergin</td>
			<td>jaynelle</td> 
			<td>7</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p><i>Portal Students that do not appear in Scilympiad:</i> Sometimes, there is a student in the list above that does have a permission on file, but the identifying information doesn&rsquo;t match closely enough for VASO to detect this.  In such cases, you will see the student appear in this list also.  To remedy this situation, please reply to this email and tell us which students should match.  Once you do this, these student records will be properly matched in the future.</p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Last Name</th>
			<th>First Name</th>
			<th>Nickname</th>
			<th>Grade</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>bejjanki</td>
			<td>murali</td> 
			<td>nikki</td>
			<td>8</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>dasari</td>
			<td>sreehitha</td> 
			<td>sree</td>
			<td>6</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>VASO will resend this report every few days up until the tournament.  As parents submit permissions, you should see fewer students in the first list.  When all your students have permissions on file, then VASO will stop sending this report.</p>

	<p>There is one unusual case that requires special action.  If a student appears in both lists, in grade 3 in one and a different grade in the other, then it is important to ensure that the grade is correct in Scilympiad.  This may require creating a new Scilympiad account for the student.</p>

	<p>If you have any questions, you can reply to this email.</p>
